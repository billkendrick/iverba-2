 * Make flame red when meter is very high (h/t Bob C "darwinmac" @ AtariAge)
 * Fine-tune letter meter speeds
 * Improve dictionary (> 15 char alphabet)
   + Concept: TBD
 * Support for other dictionaries (German, Italian, etc.)
   + After expanding the number of supported characters (from 15),
     this will need support for additional character glpyhs.
   + The full alphabet of English + French + Spanish + German + Polish +
     Hungarian consists of 56 symbols:
     - A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
     - À Á Â Ç È É Ê Ë Î Ï Ñ Ó Ô Ö Ù Ú Û Ü ß Ą Ć Ę Ł Ń Ő Ś Ű Ÿ Ź Ż
     (Note: Add Italian, and there are a few more; other characters with
     acute, grave, or circumflex accents.)
   + 56 symbols (plus blank for padding, or a stop character to end words)
     would fit within 5 bits (0-63), however...
   + With blank space, and 8 meter symbols, that's one too many characters
     (65) to render in GRAPHICS 2 mode (only 64 possible).
   + It may be sufficient to simply ignore diacritic symbols, while allowing
     players to enter words that would have them.  e.g.,
     "BAGAZJA" would be acceptable as either "bagazją" (luggage) or
     "bagazja" (baggage).  In that case, only the German "ß"
     (e.g., to allow "ABFRAß" (eroded))
