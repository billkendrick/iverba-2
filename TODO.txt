TODO for Invenies Verba 2.0
2021-07-25

 * Make flame red when meter is very high (h/t Bob C "darwinmac" @ AtariAge)
 * Fine-tune letter meter speeds
 * FIXME: Ensure dictionary includes diacritic-having words, and allows entry
   (e.g., in Spanish, "CUBITO" for "cÃºbito"; there is no "cubito")
 * Improve dictionary (> 15 char alphabet)
   + Concept: TBD
 * Support switching to other dictionaries
